# Finding-smallest-sub-sequence-from-a-given-string-which-contains-all-the-characters-from-given-char-
Finding the smallest sub-sequence from the given string which contains all the characters from the given char array?

This repo contains two programs, one- substring.py and the other is substringv2.py.

The former one implements only one set of character array ['x','y','z'].
The later can work on any set of characters.

For giving dynamic input, please change the 'characters' array and 'inputString' in the program.
